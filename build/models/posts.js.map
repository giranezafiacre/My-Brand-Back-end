For example, machines that \r\n    calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition \r\n    are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, \r\n    since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.`,\r\n    author: 'Admin'\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    title: 'Software design in software production',\r\n    content: `software design is a process to transform user requirements into some \r\n    suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.\r\n    For assessing user requirements, an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) \r\n    document is created whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of \r\n    more specific and detailed requirements in software terms. The output of this \r\n    process can directly be used into implementation in programming languages.Modular \r\n    design unintentionally follows the rules of ‘divide and conquer’ problem-solving \r\n    strategy this is because there are many other benefits attached with the modular \r\n    design of a software.Software Design Levels:*Architectural Design - The architectural \r\n    design is the highest abstract version of the system.

Other technologies besides HTML \r\n    are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/\r\n    behavior (JavaScript).\"Hypertext\" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, \r\n    either within a single website or between websites.Links are a fundamental aspect of the \r\n    Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, \r\n    you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML uses \"markup\" to annotate text, \r\n    images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special \"elements\" \r\n    such as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, \r\n    canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, output, progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others.               \r\n    An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by \"tags\", which consist of the element                        \r\n    name surrounded by \"<\" and \">\" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That                           \r\n    is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag                            \r\n    can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way.`,\r\n    \r\n    author: 'Liliane'\r\n}\r\n];\r\nposts = posts.map((post) => ({ id: uuidv4(), ...post }));\r\nexport default posts;"],"file":"posts.js"}
